## Project Goals

- we're focusing on making a beautiful theme for the cytu.be page at cytu.be/r/always_always_sunny

- we can can access css , nothing else. We have no limit on the size of the css file.

- we must be able to be responsive towards both landscape and portrait users.

- a landscape user will have a large video frame on the left side. The chat shall be on the right column.

- a portrait user will have a large video towards the top of the screen, a large chat under that video frame, and the playlist under that.

- We will always place the playlists on the bottom of the screen, both with landscape and portrait users.

- we must always exude irish pride and always-sunny-in-phildelphia character and trashiness.
